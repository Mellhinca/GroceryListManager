# Test Plan

**Author**: Team JMASK

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall Strategy 

**Unit-test:** We will do unit testing to check if our code's logic works properly. Unit testing will ensure us if the particular method achived its function successfully. Unit testing will be performed by the testing-group of the team
**Integration-test:** Since our methods and classes are integrated and depended with each other we need to do integration testing in order to ensure our application runs perfectly. We also need integration- testing to test our application in a real device or in a emulator. Integration testing will be performed by the testing group of the team.
**System-test:** To verify if all system elements work properly and the overall system function has achived successfully we will do system-testing. Alpha- testing process will be selected for this activities that will be performed by all the team members. 
**Regression-test:** We will do Regression-testing after making any changes in the system. We will use regression test selection technniques for this testing process.

### 1.2 Test Selection

We will use black-box technique to select our test cases.

### 1.3 Adequacy criterion

We will outputting pass/fails matrics of each test cases in every level of testing. For Instance, in unit testing we will provide expected result and input in order to determine code quality problem.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

When the tester will find the defect in the application, he will request the developers to modify the application by giving bug description, status, severity, priority etc. 


### 1.5 Technology 

We intend to use JUnit technology for testing process.

## 2 Test Cases 

Examples of some possible test cases has given below:
